# kFlightPanel
A Navbal and indicator readout for your 2nd monitor, using Python and Telemachus for Kerbal Space Program

Based on the spirit of the Control-Panel application, this is a near complete rewrite using PyGame instead of nCurses. Calls to Telemachus are streamlined, a nav ball is operational, and performance is above 5 fps on my test computer. Time to start getting your ship's data on another computer screen!

To use:
  * In config.py - Edit the IP address of your computer running Kerbal Space Program with the Telemachus mod installed 
  * Optionally configure the fullscreen or windowed mode by commenting ("#") out the appropriate line
  * Launch the program using "python kFlightPanel.py"
  
If the application is unable to connect to Telemachus/KSP, it will enter a demo mode where the navball rotates in place. If this happens, check your IP address in config.py as well as your firewall on both computers.
  
Requirements:
  * This application requires PyGame libraries, and is only tested on python 2.7.6 on Ubuntu Linux
  * Telemachus mod for Kerbal Space Program
  * IPv4 Networking
  
Future Plans:
  * Update to Python 3
  * Better handling of different screen sizes
  * Connection stability improvements and error handling
